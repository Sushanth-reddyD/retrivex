        Introduction
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables
        computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Types of Learning
        
        There are three main types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
        learning. Each has its own use cases and characteristics.
        
        Supervised Learning
        
        In supervised learning, models learn from labeled training data. The
        algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example pairs.
        Common applications include classification and regression.
        
        Unsupervised Learning
        
        Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. It discovers
        hidden structures without explicit guidance from labels.
        
        Applications
        
        Machine learning powers many modern applications including recommendation
        systems, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing.
